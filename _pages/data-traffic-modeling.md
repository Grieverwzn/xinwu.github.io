### Computational graph-based travel demand modeling;

The researcher has developed a tensor- and computational graph-based learning framework to advance physics-informed machine learning in travel demand modeling. This line of work leverages forward and backward propagation to unify classical transportation models with modern machine learning techniques. Key contributions include:

* **Integration of the Classic Four-Step Method**
  Developed a unified computational graph framework that integrates **trip generation, trip distribution, route choice, and traffic assignment** into a single end-to-end forward/backward propagation model.

* **Integrated Public Transit Passenger Demand Modeling**&#x20;

* Constructed an integrated model for transit systems that simultaneously estimates **boarding and alighting flows, origin-destination (OD) demand, line choice behavior across service categories, and network-wide assignment**.

* **Policy Impact Marginal Analysis**
  Applied computational graph **marginal analysis** techniques to evaluate the economic effects of transportation policies on demand, service equity, and system efficiency.

* **Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Traffic State Estimation**&#x20;

* Designed a computational graph-based, physics-informed ML framework for bottleneck traffic state estimation, capturing flow dynamics and congestion spillbacks.

* **Ongoing Research: Physics-Informed Short-Term Prediction**
  Extending the approach to short-term traffic speed and flow prediction by embedding traffic flow theory into a physics-informed computational graph for robust forecasting.
