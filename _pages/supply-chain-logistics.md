My work in traffic system and network modeling focuses on:

- Developing optimization and equilibrium models for multimodal transportation networks.  
- Applying computational graph and variational inequality frameworks to traffic assignment.  
- Integrating behavioral models (e.g., logit-based mode choice) into network flow modeling.  
- Designing simulation-based approaches for urban traffic management and planning.
