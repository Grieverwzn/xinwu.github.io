I am **Xin (Bruce) Wu**, a Research Associate working at the **Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Villanova University**.
I am a researcher specializing in transportation modeling and logistics management.
My work focuses on developing innovative OR models, advanced analytical methods, and optimization algorithms to address complex challenges in transportation systems, mobility services, supply chain networks, and logistics operations. I received my Ph.D. in Transportation Engineering from Beijing Jiaotong University, where I was recognized as an outstanding doctoral graduate. I have held research positions in both academia and industry. I served as research scholars at Villanova University, the University of Maryland and Arizona State University, where I contributed extensively to projects funded by government agencies such as the Fedral Transit Administration (FTA), Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT), the Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG), the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT), and the Northern Virginia Transportation Authority (NVTA). Before my research experience in the United States, Dr. Wu worked at the Beijing Transport Institute, where he participated in large-scale transportation modeling and policy analysis projects. My research interests include transportation management and planning, travel demand modeling, transportation system optimization, supply chain management, logistics system design, and railway operations. He has extensive experience developing computational models and applying optimization methods to solve complex challenges in multimodal transportation and logistics systems.
